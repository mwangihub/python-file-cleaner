# Desktop and Downloads Cleaner

A simple Python script that cleans files from your Desktop and Downloads folders. This project includes an executable created with PyInstaller, allowing you to run the script without needing a Python environment.

## Features

- Cleans specified file types from your Desktop and Downloads folders
- Easy-to-use executable for quick cleanup

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the script directly from the source code, you need to have Python installed on your machine. If you prefer to use the executable, you don't need any prerequisites.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mwangihub/python-file-cleaner.git
   cd desktop-downloads-cleaner
   ```

2. **Using the Executable:**

   - Download the executable file from the [releases page](https://github.com/yourusername/desktop-downloads-cleaner/releases).
   - Run the executable to clean your Desktop and Downloads folders.

3. **Running from Source:**

   - Run the script:

     ```bash
     python cleaner.py
     ```

### Usage

By default, the script cleans specific file types. You can modify the script to specify different file types or directories.

### Creating the Executable

If you want to create the executable yourself, you can use PyInstaller. Install PyInstaller:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

Then run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile cleaner.py
```

This will generate a `dist` folder containing the `cleaner.exe` file.
